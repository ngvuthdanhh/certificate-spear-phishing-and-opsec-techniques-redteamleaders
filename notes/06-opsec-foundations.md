# 06. OPSEC Foundations

Operational Security (OPSEC) ensures your actions cannot be attributed.

## 🛡 OPSEC Priorities
1. Hide operator identity  
2. Conceal true infrastructure  
3. Minimize forensic artifacts  
4. Protect sensitive engagement data  

## 🔍 OPSEC Mistakes to Avoid
- Reusing domains between engagements  
- Using personal writing patterns  
- Leaving metadata in documents  
- Reusing SSH keys or TLS certificates  

## 🏗 Infrastructure OPSEC
- Redirectors between operator and victim  
- Segmented servers by function  
- Mismatched geographic hosting  
- No overlap with personal IP ranges  

OPSEC is not optional—it's mandatory.
