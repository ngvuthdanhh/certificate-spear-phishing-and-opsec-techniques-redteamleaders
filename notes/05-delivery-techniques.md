# 05. Delivery Techniques

Phishing is not only “sending an email” — it requires strategy.

## 📩 Email-Based Delivery
- Classic attachment phishing  
- Link-based phishing  
- Calendar invite phishing  
- Thread hijacking (in authorized simulations)  

## 📂 Attachment Types
- PDFs  
- Office documents (with caution)  
- HTML smuggling files  
- Zip archives  

## 🔗 Link-Based Delivery
- Tracking links  
- Redirect chains  
- Unique URL tokens  

Each technique must balance **engagement success** vs **OPSEC risk**.
