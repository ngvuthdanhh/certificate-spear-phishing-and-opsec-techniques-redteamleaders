# 03. Pretexting & Lure Design

Crafting a believable story is the core of spear phishing.

## 🧠 Principles of Effective Pretexting
- Match the target's daily routine  
- Align with the organization’s language  
- Avoid complex or unusual contexts  
- Use urgency sparingly  

## 🎯 Components of a Strong Lure
### 1️⃣ Context
Why the target is receiving this message.

### 2️⃣ Relevance
It must align with their role or current activities.

### 3️⃣ Credibility Indicators
- Formatting  
- Sender identity  
- Signatures  
- Headers  

### 4️⃣ Action Request
A clear, simple CTA (e.g., “Review the attached document”).

## 🧪 Types of Lures
- Policy updates  
- Invoice or payment requests  
- HR notifications  
- Software updates  
- Internal document requests  

The lure should appear **routine**, not extraordinary.
