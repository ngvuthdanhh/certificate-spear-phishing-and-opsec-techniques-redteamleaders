# Lab 5 — OPSEC Breakdown Analysis
Analyze real-world case studies of OPSEC failures to understand how attribution occurs and how defenders leverage mistakes.

---

## Objectives
- Understand real OPSEC failure mechanisms  
- Map how small mistakes escalate to attribution  
- Identify defender opportunities in each failure  
- Strengthen awareness of behavioral leaks  

---

## Steps

### 1. Review Provided Case Studies
Identify:
- Writing-style leaks  
- Metadata correlations  
- Timing patterns  
- Account cross-usage mistakes  

### 2. Trace the Attribution Chain
For each failure:
- Identify the initial leak  
- Show how it escalated  
- Document the final attribution point  

### 3. Map Defensive Value
Explain how defenders can use:
- Metadata  
- Linguistic clustering  
- Infrastructure relationships  
- Behavioral analysis  

### 4. Write an OPSEC Breakdown Summary
Include:
- Root cause  
- Escalation path  
- Preventive lessons

## Deliverables
- Case-study breakdown  
- Attribution mapping diagram  
- OPSEC-lesson summary
