# Lab 3 — Infrastructure & OPSEC Lab
Learn how poor operator OPSEC leads to attribution and how defenders detect patterns across messages and infrastructure.

---

## Objectives
- Identify OPSEC risks  
- Understand metadata leakage  
- Detect behavioral and linguistic fingerprints  
- Recognize infrastructure reuse patterns  

---

## Steps

### 1. Metadata Analysis
Review samples (headers, documents) for:
- Creator metadata  
- Timezone leaks  
- Software version info  
- Language configuration  

### 2. Linguistic Fingerprint Detection
Look for:
- Specific idioms  
- Sentence patterns  
- Repeated punctuation behavior  
- Regional spellings  

### 3. Infrastructure Pattern Recognition
Analyze:
- Domain naming style  
- Hosting provider patterns  
- Timing of network activity  
- Reused TLS cert patterns  

### 4. Attribution Risk Assessment
Write how an attacker could be deanonymized through:
- Behavioral clustering  
- Metadata correlation  
- Infrastructure overlaps

## Deliverables
- OPSEC weakness report  
- Pattern correlation table  
- Attribution-risk summary
